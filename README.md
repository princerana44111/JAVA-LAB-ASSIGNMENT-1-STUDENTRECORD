# Student Record Management System (Java)

This is my Lab Assignment 1 for Java Programming.  
The aim of the program is to store student records like roll number, name,
course, marks and then calculate the grade based on marks.

## Features

- Display all student records
- Grade is calculated automatically
- Uses class + constructor + methods
- Stored using array of objects

## How grading works
A = 90 and above  
B = 75 to 89  
C = 50 to 74  
D = below 50  

## How to run
